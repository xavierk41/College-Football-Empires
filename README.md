# College-Football-Empires
With College Football Empires, each county is assigned as a territory to the college located closest to it (with FBS teams only; FCS teams can win territory though). A team can take over another's territory by beating them in a football game.The College Football Empires idea began with Nathan Bingham, and he describes what it is to SBNation in the following link: https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2018/9/4/17816706/college-football-imperialism-map-week-1-2018 
I have uploaded my Jupyter Notebook that creates the needed csv file for this data visualization, which can be found here on Tableau Public: 
I also included any datasets I used for this project; the links and citations for their retrieval are in the Jupyter Notebook.
