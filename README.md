# College-Football-Empires
With College Football Empires, each US county is assigned to the FBS Division 1 university located closest to the county's geographic center. When one team beats another team in a college football game, the winner gains the loser's territory. This continues throughout the whole season week by week until the season is finished. The College Football Empires idea began with Nathan Bingham, and he describes what it is to SBNation in the following link: https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2018/9/4/17816706/college-football-imperialism-map-week-1-2018 .
I have uploaded my Jupyter Notebook that creates the needed csv file for this data visualization, which can be found here on Tableau Public: https://public.tableau.com/profile/xavier.kingston#!/vizhome/CollegeFootballEmpires2019-2020/EmpireOverview?publish=yes.
I also included any datasets I used for this project; the links and citations for their retrieval are in the Jupyter Notebook.
